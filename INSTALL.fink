INSTALL on MacOS X with fink
============================

If you have a MacOS X system and the cfitsio/ccfits library
installed with fink. Then use this command to
configure the program:

cd  build
env CPPFLAGS=-I/sw/include LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib cmake ..

(assuming that you have installed the fink sources in /sw ! )
