Basic Installation
==================

   We use the cmake http://www.cmake.org/ integrated configuration and build system.

After unpacking the software you need to do the following steps:

 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 make
 # make install  if you want to install the binary



Compilers and Options
=====================

   If the basic automatic configuration fails or you need special options
for the compiler and linking you can specify these with environment
variables.

E.g.:

 - env CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++-5 cmake ..

   will use the g++-5 compiler.

 - env CXXFLAGS=-g cmake ..

   will add the additional option -g

- env LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib cmake ..

   will add an additional library path

- env CXXFLAGS=-I/sw/include cmake ..

   will add an additional include path


Documentation
=============


Debugging of the Compilation steps
==================================

   cmake doesn't show all commands during compilations. You can use

  make VERBOSE=1

  to show also the complete compiler commands.
